//! CryptoBallot is a cryptographically secure online voting system, providing secure anonymous voting with end-to-end verifiability.
//!
//! It is currenly under active development and is not production ready.
//!
//! CryptoBallot is fundamentally a transaction processor and validator. When transactions are validated in order, it creates an end-to-end verifiable voting system.
//!

//!  - **Transaction 4: Decryption Transaction** - Decrypt a vote, allowing it to be tallied.
//!  - **Election Authority** - Creates an Election Transaction and distributes the encryption secret to trustees via Shamir Secret Sharing.
//!  - **Trustee** - Holds a vote-decryption secret share, posts Secret Share Transactions.
//!  - **Authenticator** - Certifies that a voter can vote an election and ballot using blind-signing.
